```{r setup, include=FALSE}
test = testw
```



```{r cars}
library(plyr)
as.data.frame(test)
as.numeric(test$Count)
x <- ggplot(test, aes(Tissue, Count))

y <- x + geom_bar(stat = "identity")

y + scale_fill_discrete(name = "Title")

y

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
